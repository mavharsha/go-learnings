- Getting address of variables
- Dereferencing pointers
- Modifying values through pointers

### **Pointer Operations**
- Pointer comparison
- Pointer to pointer
- Modifying through double pointer
- Pointer to zero value
- Checking for nil pointers
- Safe dereferencing

### **Pointers to Different Types**
- Pointers to primitive types
- Pointers to structs
- Pointers to arrays
- Pointers to slices

### **Pointers and Functions**
- Function that takes a pointer
- Function that returns a pointer
- Value vs pointer parameters
- Value vs pointer returns

### **Pointers and Structs**
- Method with value receiver
- Method with pointer receiver
- Method with value receiver (doesn't modify original)
- Pointer to struct

### **Pointers and Arrays**
- Array and pointer to array
- Modifying array through pointer
- Shorthand for array pointer access

go run go_pointers_simple.go
```

## 📚 Key Takeaways

- **Pointers provide efficient memory management** - avoid copying large data
- **Always check for nil pointers** before dereferencing
- **Use pointers for large structs** to avoid copying
- **Go has garbage collection** - no manual memory management needed
- **Pointer arithmetic is limited** in Go for safety
